Hi My name is Sameera Madusanka

I have done this assessment using .Net version 8.0.403
I have used xUnit and FakeItEasy for unit testing

In the code there are few assumptions
    1. Email assumed sent out
    2. Email sending failed exception will never hit in current implementation

I have created this project in VS code using dotnet CLI because I'm using a macbook and I cannot install Visual Studio.

To run the project use below steps
    1. Open project folder in VS code
    2. run "dotnet restore" command in terminal
    3. run "dotnet run" command in terminal

To run the project use below steps
    1. run "dotnet test" command in terminal
